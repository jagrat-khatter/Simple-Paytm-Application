
1. Will userId be ObjectId of userSchema?
Yes.

userId is of type mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId and has ref: 'User'.
This means it should store the _id value (which is an ObjectId) of a document from the User model 
(created from schema1).

2. In what conditions will it create an account?

An account document will be created when you explicitly create it in your code 
(e.g., with Account.create(...) or new Account(...)).

********You must provide a valid userId (an existing user's _id) and a balance value.

Example:
const account = await Account.create({
  userId: someUser._id, // _id from a User document
  balance: 1000
});

3. Is ref: 'User' the model name or collection name?

It is the model name as defined here:

const User = mongoose.model('User', schema1);

Mongoose uses the model name ('User') to know which collection to reference.
By default, Mongoose will look for the collection named 'users' (lowercase, pluralized).
